## contactWorks
For this project I have created end points for functionalities similar to 'True Caller'. Some of these functionalities are displaying user details on receiving an incoming call, determining if a number is a spam or not, searching, clicking. The main stack used is node.js express and sequelize. We have used the MySQL database to store the data for the application. Express and sequelize will be used to push and pull data from the database. Postman is used to host the endpoints. The outputs for the respective endpoints are displayed in the form of JSON
