## contactWorks
## For this project I have created points for functionalities similar to 'True Caller'. Some of these functionalities are displaying user details on receiving an incoming call, determining if a number is a spam or not, searching, clicking. The main stack used is node.js express and sequelize. We have used the MySQL database and postman to host the endpoints.
